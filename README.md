# MARL_MADDPG_MPE
This is an implementation of Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm which could play with the PettingZoo Environment, MPE Simple Adversary.

Note: This implementation is based on [Hands-on RL](https://github.com/boyu-ai/Hands-on-RL). In order to migrate the code to where it could play with PettingZoo, we looked at the logical structure of the project and made many modifications and adaptations based on it, finally implementing our code.
